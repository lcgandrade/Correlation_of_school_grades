# About
<p> open the PCA principal components algorithm black box and understand each phase </p>

# Requirements
<p> I recommend downloading the R cran installer https://cran.r-project.org/ and later the RStudio software https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ to run the scripts below and view the interactions </p>

# Problem
<p> I need to understand if certain subjects in which students have low grades are correlated with each other and generate a report to the teaching direction in order to help the institution's continuous improvement </p>

# Solution
<p> Create an algorithm capable of analyzing the correlation between variables and reducing the dimension of variables without affecting the quality of the data. </p>

# Method
<p> Create an unsupervised machine learning algorithm using the PCA principal component analysis method. </p>

# Visualization
<p>  </p>

# Conclusion
